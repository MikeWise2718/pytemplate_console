# Console Template

- To activate python from the `.venv` use `.venv/scripts/activate`
- From a DOS prompt use `.venv\scripts\activate`
- to change the version of python in that `.venv` 


## To do
- rationalize switch template code
   - categorize the things we are likely to want to do
   - make those things
   - get rid of the leftovers cruft

- Add launch.json for debuggins
- Add color coded output
